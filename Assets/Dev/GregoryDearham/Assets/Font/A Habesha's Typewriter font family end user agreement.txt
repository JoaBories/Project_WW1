Olympia International typewriter that was manufactured in the 1970s, around 40 years after 
the Ethiopian engineer Ayana Biru worked with an Italian company to develop the first 
Amharic typewriter.

This typewriter font is based on high resolution scans of the Olympia International typewriter, 
which was manufactured in the 1970s.This typewriter was made 40 years after the Ethiopian
 engineer Ayana Biru worked with an Italian company named Olivetti in order to develop the 
first Amharic typewriter. Some have gone as far as to say that Ayana Biru was the father of 
modern typography because he introduced the Ethiopian script to the modern age. 
Moreover, typographers that have come after him have based their typesets on the 
typewriter font.
